# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail.df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv", header=TRUE, sep = "\t", encoding = "utf-8")

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
#Use br/ html tag to separate intor rows
ingr.df <- separate_rows(cocktail.df, ingredients, sep = "<br/>", convert = TRUE)
ingr.df <- separate_rows(ingr.df, ingredients, sep = "<br>", convert = TRUE)

# any more occurences?
which(mapply(grepl, pattern="<", x=ingr.df$ingredients) )

  #get rid of that
  ingr.df <- separate_rows(ingr.df, ingredients, sep = "<b4/>", convert = TRUE)

# Let's remove alcohol content --> remove contents in brackets
ingr.df$ingredients <- gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)","",as.character(ingr.df$ingredients))

#remove any quantifier words
specific_word <- c("dash"
                   , "dashes"
                   , "drops"
                   ,"drop"
                   , "sugared"
                   ,"sugard"
                   , "oz"
                   ,"bsp")
pattern <- paste0('\\w*', specific_word, collapse = '|')
ingr.df$ingredients <- gsub(pattern,"",as.character(ingr.df$ingredients))

# remove numerals and fraction signs

ingr.df$ingredients <- gsub("[0-9]+","",as.character(ingr.df$ingredients))
ingr.df$ingredients <- gsub("/","",as.character(ingr.df$ingredients))
ingr.df$ingredients <- gsub("\\.","",as.character(ingr.df$ingredients))

#white spaces and other clutter

ingr.df$ingredients <- trimws(ingr.df$ingredients)

#minor adjustments

ingr.df$ingredients[177] <- "80-proof rye"
ingr.df$ingredients[187] <- "100-proof rye"

#Convert them to titles

require(stringr)

ingr.df$ingredients <- str_to_title(ingr.df$ingredients)

cocktail.df <- ingr.df

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}

list(sort(cocktail.df$ingredients))



```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
count(as.data.frame(table(cocktail.df$ingredients)))

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

top10 <- data.frame(table(cocktail.df$ingredients))

top10 %>% 
  top_n(11) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Freq))

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

name.ingr <- as.data.frame(table(cocktail.df$name))
names(name.ingr)[names(name.ingr) == "Freq"] <- "Ingredients.Num"

name.ingr %>% top_n(6) %>% arrange(desc(Ingredients.Num))

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}

only.1 <- as.data.frame(table(cocktail.df$ingredients))

rare <- only.1 %>% filter(Freq == 1)

count(rare)

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
